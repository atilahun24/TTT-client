Insert description og project here

technologies used:
HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, AJAX

I chose an unconventional method of working on my game logic and API at the same time as opposed to working on one then the other. I first constructed a basic html layout of my game then started working on some of the logic while, in the back of my mind, tracking how I would relate this logic to the API. Getting the project started was the most difficult part, the further along I got, the more comfortable I started to feel with not only with the material I was practicing but with the overall course as well. This project forced to tie everything weâ€™ve learned so far together.
